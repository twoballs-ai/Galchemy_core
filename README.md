# TETTE Core

TETTE Core is a core library for creating games and interactive applications, providing powerful tools and flexibility for development. The project supports working with WebGL and WebGPU, making it suitable for implementing various gaming and interactive projects. TETTE Core can be used both independently and in conjunction with a graphical user interface (GUI), which is planned to be added in the future.

> **Note**: The project is at an early stage of development and may currently contain significant shortcomings. We recommend waiting for a more stable release to avoid possible disappointment.
